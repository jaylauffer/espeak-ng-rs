# Rust migration

Jay requested a native Rust port of this fork on 2026-10-04, with loadngo's
proactor where applicable and NPU use where useful. This is an incremental
replacement of the engine. It is not yet a complete Rust synthesizer.
The retained C implementation at the starting commit `ba90c8e9` is the
behavior oracle, including this fork's language data and Unicode version.

## Implemented

| Original module | Native Rust implementation | Engine status |
|---|---|---|
| `encoding.c` | `rust/encoding.rs`, fixed encoding tables | Replaces C with `USE_RUST_CORE=ON`; all encodings, aliases, AUTO, wide strings and cursor API |
| `mnemonics.c` | `rust/mnemonics.rs` plus byte-exact C adapter | Replaces C; first match and sentinel defaults |
| `ieee80.c` | `rust/ieee80.rs` | Replaces C; AIFF sample-rate decoding |
| All six `ucd-tools/src/*.c` modules | `rust/unicode.rs`, fixed tables | Replaces C; categories, scripts, properties, case conversion and character classifiers |
| `phoneme.c` | `rust/phoneme.rs` | Replaces C; 16-byte phoneme records, feature names and articulatory-feature mutations |
| Compiled dictionary storage | `rust/dictionary.rs` | Safe borrowed parser, record iterator and byte hash; contextual lookup/rule execution still C |
| Data I/O | `rust/data_io.rs`, optional `proactor` feature | Native library API; caller-owned loadngo proactor, reusable bounded buffer, one read in flight; legacy C loader not switched yet |
| Accelerator capability | `rust/acceleration.rs`, optional `npu` feature | Core ML device discovery on macOS; portable CPU fallback; no NPU speech computation enabled |

The safe library has no runtime dependency on the C engine. The `c-abi`
feature adds only the compatibility exports; it does not wrap C algorithms.
Normal Cargo builds use committed native tables. Regeneration alone uses
the original C files as a data oracle, via `tools/generate_rust_tables.py`.
The port retains GPL-3.0-or-later and original notices; see `COPYING` and
`COPYING.UCD` for engine/data licensing.

## Build and use

From the repository root, with Rust/Cargo and CMake installed:

```sh
cargo test --locked --all-features
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
python3 tools/generate_rust_tables.py --check

cmake -S . -B build-rust -DUSE_RUST_CORE=ON -DUSE_ASYNC=OFF \
  -DUSE_LIBPCAUDIO=OFF -DUSE_LIBSONIC=OFF -DUSE_MBROLA=OFF
cmake --build build-rust --parallel 3
ctest --test-dir build-rust --parallel 3 --output-on-failure

ESPEAK_DATA_PATH="$PWD/build-rust" build-rust/src/espeak-ng -xq -v en "Hello world"
ESPEAK_DATA_PATH="$PWD/build-rust" build-rust/src/espeak-ng -w /tmp/hello.wav -v en "Hello world"

cargo run --locked --features npu --example hardware
```

The original C build remains available with `USE_RUST_CORE=OFF` (the
default during migration). Each CMake build has its own Cargo target
directory. Cross builds must specify `ESPEAK_RUST_TARGET` to match the C
target and install that Rust target/toolchain. A host Rust archive must
never be linked into a different C architecture. Sanitizer builds currently
instrument the remaining C code, not the Rust archive.

## Proactor contract

Enable `proactor` and pass the host's `ProactorHandle<P>` to
`DataReader::read`. Open files during initialization or on the host's
existing offload path using `open_data_file`; file opening is synchronous.
Windows opens use `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` for IOCP. Positioned reads then use
loadngo's platform file I/O path (including its worker offload on macOS).
No independent proactor, polling loop, timer thread or per-read worker
is constructed by the library.

Each reader allocates one 1-byte to 1-MiB chunk buffer, and clones share it.
Busy admission returns `WouldBlock`; successful completions reuse the same
allocation, including after short reads and EOF. A callback borrows the
chunk and must return promptly. Submit the next chunk after returning to
the host. Exceptional I/O failures replenish a buffer because the port's
error API does not return its buffer. Keep assembled dictionary/phoneme
data resident; do not reload it per utterance or audio callback.

The reader retains the file until completion. Cancellation uses the
returned `IoOpId` and `handle.cancel_io`; cancelling does not immediately
return the buffer. Shutdown must stop and drain the host's proactor.
CPU-heavy translation/synthesis must eventually run on a bounded host
offload path, with completion delivery through the proactor.
`enqueue_work` alone is completion delivery, not CPU offload.

## NPU boundary

The hardware example queries public Core ML device capability through
loadngo, once at initialization. On this Mac on 2026-10-04 it reported
`[Npu, Cpu]`. That is available hardware, not a trace of NPU speech execution.
The feature also exposes loadngo's `PreparedCompute`, `ComputePolicy` and
`DeviceKind` contracts for later eligible partitions. Other platforms
currently report only CPU; no platform NPU implementation is claimed.

The current work consists of byte decoding, dictionary and Unicode table
lookups. These do not map usefully to dense neural execution. The original
formant/ Klatt synthesizers use small harmonic loops and recurrent filters;
their accelerator feasibility remains unmeasured. Do not introduce a
different neural voice or artificial projection benchmark as evidence
that this engine was accelerated. Before enabling an actual partition,
measure representative shapes, submission/copy latency, output parity,
end-to-end utterance latency, and thermal behavior. A `CpuAndNpu` policy
allows CPU fallback and does not prove Neural Engine execution.

## Validation evidence, 2026-10-04

All results below are local to this checkout and Mac; Linux/Windows
runtime execution awaits CI. The new `.github/workflows/rust.yml` runs
Cargo checks/tests on Linux, macOS and Windows, plus both static and
shared speech parity on Linux/macOS. No push or CI run has been performed.

- The unchanged C baseline configured with async/audio-device/sonic/MBROLA
  disabled: all 19 CTest tests passed.
- Rust core linked into both static and shared engine builds with the same
  configuration: all 21 CTest tests passed. The original 19 tests include
  pronunciation, numbers, SSML, voices, crash vectors and waveform hashes.
  A separate Rust-core build with the legacy asynchronous runtime enabled
  also passed all 21 tests.
- `rust-parity` compared every one of 1,114,112 Unicode codepoints: category,
  group, script, three case conversions, twelve classifiers and all 31
  property-category inputs. Also 1,001 invalid/random codepoints.
- Decoder differential coverage: 20 encodings, 1,000 random buffers each,
  supported AUTO codepage fallbacks, cursor offsets, peek state and EOF.
- IEEE80 differential coverage: 196,608 values, every exponent and sign;
  bit-exact against C except unspecified NaN payloads.
- Phoneme-feature differential coverage: all 17,576 lowercase triples applied
  to 175,760 randomized phoneme records, checking statuses and every record byte.
- The Rust compiled-dictionary parser validated every dictionary in the
  full CMake data build: 123 dictionaries (`rust-dictionaries`).
- Rust unit tests cover legacy UTF-8 boundaries, aliases, sentinel behavior,
  Unicode table invariants, dictionary records and malformed/truncated data.
- Real loadngo proactor tests cover byte content, short reads, EOF, buffer
  address reuse, busy rejection, file retention, cancellation and recovery
  after I/O failure. Cargo all-feature tests: 10 unit and 4 proactor tests pass;
  the real dictionary test is explicitly ignored by Cargo alone and run by CTest.
- All-feature cross checks compiled the Rust library for Linux AArch64,
  Windows x86-64, iOS AArch64 and Android AArch64. Cross Clippy also passed
  for Linux and Windows. These checks do not establish target runtime behavior.

Two deliberate safety improvements diverge from undefined C behavior:
reading after EOF returns zero, and invalid encoding discriminants are
rejected before indexing. AUTO with a non-codepage fallback replaces invalid
bytes as ASCII instead of dereferencing a null codepage. Valid/defined
legacy behavior is preserved, including case-sensitive aliases, the UTF-8
trailing-byte rule, U+FFFD becoming U+001A in a decoded three-byte sequence,
and permanent AUTO fallback even when first selected by `peek`.

## Remaining migration

1. Complete native dictionary rule indexing/execution and contextual lookup;
   port voice/language options and compiled phoneme data. Connect resident
   data loading to the existing proactor reader with bounded assembly limits.
2. Port clause/SSML parsing, number pronunciation and translation. Replace
   process-global mutable state with explicitly owned engine instances while
   retaining the C API's serialized compatibility behavior.
3. Port phoneme lists, stress, intonation, lengths and synthesis command queues.
4. Port formant waveform generation, Klatt, optional speechPlayer/MBROLA/sonic
   support; reuse PCM buffers and integrate bounded output/cancellation with
   the host. Evaluate NPU eligibility against measured actual workloads.
5. Port CLI/data compilers and remaining platform integrations (Android,
   Windows/SAPI, Emscripten and audio output). Remove the C dependency only
   once complete language/audio/API parity and real-platform gates pass.

Keep each replacement runnable against the retained C oracle. A complete
port must cover the whole current feature set; passing the first-stage
regressions does not establish a pure Rust speech engine or thermal safety.
